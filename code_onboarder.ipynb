    "# Phase 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Background\n",
    "Open-source software (OSS) is the backbone of modern technology, driving innovation through community collaboration. A healthy open-source project relies on a continuous influx of new contributors to fix bugs, add features, and maintain the codebase. However, diving into an unfamiliar, complex repository is one of the most daunting tasks for any developer, whether they are junior programmers or seasoned veterans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "Despite the desire to contribute to open-source, developers face a massive barrier to entry: **onboarding friction**. New contributors are often confronted with massive codebases, fragmented or outdated documentation, and complex architectural dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, a developer looking to contribute must spend hours or even days manually reading code, tracing functions, and deciphering the project's structure before writing a single line of code. This steep learning curve leads to developer frustration, abandoned pull requests, and a significant loss of potential talent for the open-source community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Solution & Approach\n",
    "To eliminate this onboarding friction, I'm building **CodeBuddy**, an AI-powered Open-Source Onboarder. CodeBuddy acts as an intelligent companion that guides developers through new codebases, explaining architecture, locating specific logic, and answering questions in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "***For assignment perspective I'm using local tech stack cannot ingest large repository yet. Once I'm able to mature it as agent running in a dedicated GPU can ingest large reposiroty***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach:\n",
    "I will tackle this problem by building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline tailored for source code:\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion & Parsing:** I will ingest the target open-source repository (code files, READMEs, and existing documentation) and parse the codebase into meaningful, logical chunks (e.g., functions, classes, and modules).\n",
    "2. **Embedding & Indexing:** These code chunks will be converted into vector embeddings and stored in a vector database, allowing for fast, semantic search capabilities.\n",
    "3. **Retrieval & Generation:** When a user asks a question (e.g., *\"Where is the database connection handled?\"* or *\"Explain how the authentication middleware works\"*), the system will retrieve the most relevant code snippets and pass them to an LLM to generate a clear, context-aware explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Large Language Models (LLMs)?\n",
    "Using an LLM is the cornerstone of CodeBuddy because traditional search tools (like `grep` or IDE text search) are vastly insufficient for true code comprehension. I need LLMs for the following reasons:\n",
    "* **Semantic Code Understanding:** LLMs go beyond keyword matching; they understand the *intent* and logic behind the code, allowing them to explain complex algorithms in plain English.\n",
    "* **Contextual Synthesis:** An LLM can look at multiple retrieved files simultaneously and synthesize an answer that explains how different components of the repository interact with each other.\n",
    "* **Interactive Guidance:** LLMs allow developers to have a dynamic, conversational back-and-forth. If a developer doesn't understand an initial explanation, they can ask the LLM to simplify it, provide an example, or trace a specific variable's journey through the codebase."

    "# Phase 2: System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we design the architecture of CodeBuddy. We will break this down step-by-step, starting with how the user interacts with the system and how the AI interprets their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Conversation Initialization & Intent Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before CodeBuddy can search the repository or explain code, it needs to establish a structured conversation with the user and accurately understand their goals. This interaction layer acts as the front door to our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Start a Conversation (LLM Initialization)\n",
    "To initiate the conversation, we must instantiate the LLM with a specific \"System Prompt\" and memory management. This ensures the model behaves like an expert developer rather than a generic chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **System Prompting:** We define the LLM's persona, constraints, and instructions. For example: *\"You are CodeBuddy, an expert senior engineer. Your goal is to help a junior developer onboard onto a new open-source repository. Be concise, reference specific file paths when known, and do not make up code that does not exist.\"*\n",
    "* **Session Memory:** Because onboarding requires continuous dialogue, we must initialize a chat memory object (e.g., using LangChain's `ConversationBufferMemory`). This allows the LLM to remember previous questions and maintain context throughout the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Get User Input (Intent Clarity & Confirmation)\n",
    "When a developer types a question, open-source repositories are often too large to simply search blindly. We need an intent routing mechanism to ensure we are retrieving the right kind of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Capturing Input:** The system receives the user's raw query (e.g., *\"How do I start this?\"* or *\"Where is the auth logic?\"*).\n",
    "* **Intent Clarity (Classification):** Before querying our vector database, we pass the raw input through a lightweight LLM call (or a dedicated classifier) to determine the *intent* of the question. Common intents for CodeBuddy might include:\n",
    "    * `PROJECT_SETUP`: Questions about installation, Docker, or `npm install`.\n",
    "    * `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW`: High-level questions about how services interact.\n",
    "    * `CODE_EXPLANATION`: Deep dives into specific functions or files.\n",
    "    * `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES`: Questions about how to submit a PR or run tests.\n",
    "* **Intent Confirmation:** If a user's query is highly ambiguous (e.g., *\"Explain the user stuff\"*), the system pauses. Instead of running an expensive and likely inaccurate search, CodeBuddy replies with an **Intent Confirmation** prompt: *\"It sounds like you want to know about User Authentication and Authorization. Is that correct, or are you looking for the User UI components?\"* This human-in-the-loop step ensures high-accuracy retrieval later in the pipeline."

    "## 2.1.1 Implementation: Initialization and Intent Routing (Local Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, we set up the conversational interface entirely on our local machine. This ensures that repository code and developer queries remain completely private.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation handles:\n",
    "1. **Local LLM Setup:** We initialize a local model (e.g., `llama3.1` or `mistral`) using Ollama. We set the `format=\"json\"` parameter to guarantee the model outputs strictly parsable JSON for our routing logic.\n",
    "2. **Memory:** We instantiate a `ConversationBufferMemory` to keep track of the chat history.\n",
    "3. **Intent Classifier:** We define a specific prompt that forces the LLM to analyze the user's input and categorize it, outputting the result, a confidence score, and any clarifying questions."

    "For CodeBuddy to answer questions about a repository, it first needs to \"read\" and index the code. Instead of relying on local files, our system will prompt the user for a live GitHub URL and pull the code dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase consists of three main steps:\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Loading:** We use Python's `input()` to grab the repository URL. Then, LangChain's `GitLoader` automatically clones it and loads its text files into memory.\n",
    "2. **Chunking (Code-Aware):** We split the files into smaller chunks using a Python-specific text splitter to ensure we don't accidentally slice functions or classes in half.\n",
    "3. **Embedding & Storage (ChromaDB):** We convert these text chunks into high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) using our local Ollama model and store them in **Chroma** for semantic searching."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Approach:\n",
    "1. **The Tool (`@tool`):** We define a Python function that requests the latest issues from the GitHub API. We programmatically distinguish between standard issues and Pull Requests (GitHub returns both in the same endpoint).\n",
    "2. **The Chat Model (`ChatOllama`):** We use a model class that supports the `.bind_tools()` method.\n",
    "3. **The Agent Executor:** We use LangChain's `create_tool_calling_agent` to create a loop where the LLM can \"think,\" decide to use the GitHub tool, wait for the Python script to fetch the JSON data, and finally summarize the live results for the user."
